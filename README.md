## Overview

This project is an interactive, multi-page dashboard designed to explore, compare, and analyze global quality-of-life indicators. [cite_start]Quality of life is shaped by numerous factors, but the data is often fragmented, making it difficult to analyze trends or compare regions[cite: 42, 49]. [cite_start]This tool addresses that gap by consolidating key metrics into a single, visually engaging platform to support data-driven decision-making[cite: 57].

The dashboard is built for a diverse audience, including:
* [cite_start]**Policymakers** evaluating national performance[cite: 62].
* [cite_start]**Researchers** analyzing socio-economic and environmental trends[cite: 63].
* [cite_start]**Individuals & Expats** making informed relocation or investment decisions[cite: 67].

## Key Features

The application is composed of several analytical modules:

* [cite_start]**üó∫Ô∏è World Map Explorer:** An interactive choropleth map to visualize global variations in key indicators[cite: 320]. Features dynamic filters for continents, a log-scale option for skewed data, and detailed hover-over tooltips.
* [cite_start]**üìä Country & Continent Comparison:** A side-by-side comparison tool that uses radar, bubble, and bar charts to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of any two selected entities across multiple metrics[cite: 322].
* **üìà Top vs. Bottom Analysis:** A module to instantly identify and compare the highest and lowest-performing countries for any selected indicator, complete with auto-generated textual insights that explain real-world implications.
* [cite_start]**üåç Global Metrics View:** Presents aggregate statistics and hierarchical data visualizations (like sunburst charts) to understand indicator distributions at both continental and country levels[cite: 321].
